        <h2>What I have learnt about website design while actually doing it</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I gained a variety of useful web development skills. 
          I had previously learned about web development frameworks, such as the user-friendly 
          and convenient Bootstrap, from online videos. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework 
          that offers pre-built components such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, among others. 
          One of the significant advantages of Bootstrap is its responsive design, which enables 
          the website to adapt to different screen sizes. I quickly realized the significant time-saving 
          capabilities of Bootstrap, as it can accomplish the same task in just a few pre-defined class 
          names that would otherwise require more than 100 lines of code without it. Therefore, I started 
          to widely use it in developing my websites.
        </p>
        <br >
        <p>
          However, I soon realized that relying solely on frameworks like Bootstrap was not enough to 
          develop customized solutions. As Bootstrap has limited styles, I recognized that I will face 
          diverse user requirements in my future career. Therefore, understanding the underlying 
          principles of web development is crucial to solve different problems and create customized 
          solutions. By gaining this understanding, I am better equipped to create unique, responsive, 
          and optimized websites that fulfill my clients' needs.
        </p>
        <br >
        <p>
          During the project, I completed the website's design and functional development independently 
          without relying on external tools. This project was a turning point for me because it allowed 
          me to fully apply my skills and knowledge to a real-world scenario. Through this experience, 
          I learned the importance of understanding the fundamental principles of web development, 
          including how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to achieve specific functions. I was 
          able to develop my website from scratch, which included designing the layout, creating the 
          navigation bar, and integrating features such as an image gallery, a contact form. This valuable 
          experience has advanced me on the path towards becoming an independent front-end developer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the project introduced me to various new technologies, such as image maps, grid 
          image galleries, and image slideshows, which will be useful experience for my future career 
          and work. By expanding my knowledge of different web development technologies, I can provide 
          better solutions for my clients and stay updated with the latest trends and innovations in the industry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In conclusion, this project has been invaluable in helping me develop crucial web development 
          skills, and it emphasized the significance of understanding fundamental principles to become a 
          successful front-end developer. By expanding my knowledge and experience, I can continue to 
          improve my skills and provide better solutions for my clients.
