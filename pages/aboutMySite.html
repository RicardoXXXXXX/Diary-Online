        <h2>What I have learnt about website design while actually doing it</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I learned many helpful web development skills. Before
          this semester, I learned a few web development skills from video
          channels. I mainly learned how to use the frameworks in web
          development, such as Bootstrap which is very convenient and
          user-friendly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, I didn't realize the importance of understanding the basic
          principles behind them, such as how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work
          together to achieve some specific functions. In fact, some functions
          may need more than 100 lines of code, but only need to include a few
          Bootstrap pre-defined class names in the HTML by using Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During the development of this project, for the first time, I
          completed all the design and function development of the website by
          myself without relying on the help of external tools. This precious
          experience helped me take a step further on the road to becoming a
          front-end programmer who can develop independently. As the quantity of
          styles on Bootstrap is limited, the user requirement I will face in my
          future career is ultimate. It's always necessary to understand the
          principles behind the scene so I can be able to solve different
          problems.
